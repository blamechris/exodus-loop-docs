# Claude Development Notes - Exodus Loop Docs

## Zero Attribution Policy

**CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST:**

Claude must NEVER include ANY of the following in commits, PRs, or any files:
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any Claude co-author line
- `Generated with Claude Code` or similar phrases

- Any emoji + "Generated with" pattern
- Any mention of Claude, Anthropic, or AI assistance in commit messages
- Any attribution in PR descriptions

**The user is the SOLE AUTHOR of all work. Period.**

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains documentation for Exodus Loop:
- GDD (Game Design Document reflecting actual implementation)
- Developer onboarding guide
- Technical references
- Tech debt tracking

## Documentation Sync Protocol

**When to sync documentation:**
1. After merging PRs that add/change gameplay features
2. After balance changes (constants, stats)
3. After adding new screens or UI components
4. After major refactoring of documented systems

**Sync checklist - review these areas for changes:**

| Main Repo Change | Docs to Update |
|------------------|----------------|
| New squadron type | `game-design/squadrons.md` |
| Carrier changes | `game-design/carriers.md` |
| Combat mechanics | `game-design/combat.md`, `developer-guide/combat-system.md` |
| New upgrades | `game-design/progression.md` |
| Balance constants | `game-design/balance.md`, `game-design/progression.md` |
| New screens | `developer-guide/screens.md` |
| New achievements | `game-design/achievements.md` |
| Pilot system | `game-design/pilots.md` |
| Save system | `developer-guide/save-system.md` |
| Exodus Fleet | `internal/exodus-fleet.md` |
| Reinforcements | `internal/reinforcements.md` |
| Crafting/Blueprints | `internal/crafting.md` |
| Alien factions | `game-design/factions.md` |
| Ship Builder V2 | `game-design/carriers.md` |

**Sync workflow:**
1. Check main repo recent commits: `git log --oneline -20` (in exodus-loop)
2. Identify feature PRs since last docs update (check GDD version date)
3. Read relevant source files to get accurate details
4. Update affected documentation pages
5. Update GDD version and date in `game-design/index.md`
6. Commit and push to deploy

**Key source files for documentation:**
- `src/autoload/balance_constants.gd` - All balance numbers
- `src/entities/squadron.gd` - Squadron stats and types
- `src/entities/carrier.gd` - Carrier types
